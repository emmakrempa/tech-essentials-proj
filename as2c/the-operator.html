			<div class="text6"><p>Jason looked over to his right, his eyes barely able to focus themselves on the subject of his attention. His neck ached terribly from the strenuous movement. He was tired.</p>

			<p>The captain’s gaze came to rest on the rookie sonar operator sitting tense at his station along the starboard side of the control room; a man of moderate height, moderate weight, and moderate intelligence. He had only just joined the crew last month, completely inexperienced, but very eager to learn. Most of the crewmen were fond of him and he didn’t get on people’s nerves much, having a rather withdrawn personality. He was primarily concerned with doing his job well, which is exactly what you want in a crewman. But therein also lay a problem- hard work was not enough to succeed in the navy. It was a profession requiring some level of innate brilliance, a thing which even the strongest work ethic could not fully replace. And so despite his every effort, the operator currently under Jason’s command lacked that nuanced discernment which separated the decent sonar men from the ones you would want by your side in combat.</p>

			<p>To be fair, it wasn’t really anyone’s fault; the rookie hadn’t chosen to be this way after all. But at that moment, Jason hated that sonar operator with every fiber of his being. It was a boundless, venomous hatred which surged through his heart with terrible ferocity. It was however, a very brief moment of hatred, for an instant later, a powerful shockwave made contact with the submarine’s hull. Jason was flung headlong out of his chair and onto the floor, colliding with something cold and metal. His head rang from the impact and a sudden urge to curse overcame him as the pain began to properly register. Fortunately, an adrenaline-fueled burst of willpower allowed him to resist this urge.</p>

			<p>“Are you alright?” came a voice which Jason recognized as belonging to Matt Palmer, his executive officer.</p>

			<p>“I’m fine” replied Jason, squinting out at the blurry outline of the control room around him. He could partially make out Palmer’s silhouette against the background of flashing lights and blurred control panels.</p>

			<p>“We’ve lost the mains, but emergency generators are coming online now.” continued Palmer, struggling to keep a steady tone in his voice as he helped Jason to his feet.</p>

			<p>With his rapidly improving vision, Jason examined his surroundings. Most of the crew had resumed their stations, though some were still recovering themselves from the jolt. The majority of the controls appeared operable, but it was difficult to know for sure.</p>

			<p>“I believe we may have lost the portside engine, but I’m not certain.” added Palmer. “Communication is very patchy in the aft sections, so we don’t know for sure. But we know the starboard engine has definitely failed.”</p>

			<p>“Weapons?”</p>

			<p>“No chance.”</p>

			<p>Jason looked over at the sonar operator, who seemed to have kept his seat.</p>

			<p>“Sonar!” he yelled viciously. “What’s happening out there?”</p>

			<p>Jason watched with a desperate impatience as the rookie scrambled to probe the seas for their enemy. The man’s panic was obvious. His shirt was already soaked through with sweat.</p>

			<p>“Well?” asked Palmer, after a moment.</p>

			<p>The room was beginning to settle, and Jason could feel the eyes of his crew directed at him, but he did not lift his hateful gaze from the sonar operator. He waited, trying to ignore the incessant throbbing in his head.</p>

			<p>“They’re re-flooding their torpedo tubes.” came the operator at last. “They’ll be able to fire again in about twenty seconds.”</p>

			<p>A few nervous mutterings emanated from around the control room, which Palmer stopped with a harsh glance.</p>

			<p>“Get in touch with damage control and tell them to standby.” ordered Jason.</p>

			<p>“Losing trim, sir.” broke in the navigator. “Depth is increasing rapidly.”</p>

			<p>“Compensate with ballast.”</p>

			<p>“Controls inoperable.” replied the ballast controller, struggling to keep his voice even.</p>

			<p>Ignoring the sudden onset of nausea and whispering curses to himself, Jason tried to think through the wall which now separated his mind from the much needed solution to this situation.</p>

			<p>“Our rate of descent is accelerating.” added the navigator.</p>

			<p>The ship’s hull creaked as their descent began to accelerate. Jason knew that with every passing second, the sinking sub put another ten metres between them and the surface. Looking down at his feet, Jason imagined the floor dissolving into transparency, giving way to a sickening picture of the endless dark depths into which he was plummeting. He felt terror creeping over him, preparing to engulf him as they silently descended into the abyss bellow.</p>

			<p>“They’ll be firing any moment now.”</p>

			<p>Jason wasn’t sure who had spoken, but it didn’t really matter. He knew his enemy was offering him a swift alternative to the death he had dreaded all his life- a death composed of staring into that bottomless void as he plunged down into its endless depths. Another minute or so would secure his fate. He prayed that he would be able to keep his sanity for just another minute. He could feel the pressure mounting around the feeble metal shell slowly falling into a kilometre of endless darkness. He shivered at the thought.</p>

			<p>“Sir, I’m detecting torpedoes in the water.”</p>

			<p>“Just another minute,” he thought. “Just hold on for another minute and die like a man.”</p>

			<p>“I think they’re coming from one of our own subs.” came the operator’s voice.</p>

			<p>Jason must have misunderstood. As far as they knew, his crew was the only one which had survived.</p>

			<p>“They’re definitely ours. The enemy sub is turning to evade.”</p>

			<p>Jason raised his head and scanned the room. Palmer was hunched over the sonar station, his eyes fixated intently on the screen in front of him. The rest of the crew were staring intently at the operator, as he listened with his utmost attention to the sounds of the undersea battlefield.</p>

			<p>“They’re hit!” cried the operator in disbelief.</p>

			<p>“Who?” asked Jason, barely able to understand what was happening.</p>

			<p>“The enemy sub is hit! It’s been taken out.”</p>

			<p>Jason closed his eyes, his head throbbing violently.</p>

			<p>“Are we still descending?” came Palmer’s voice.</p>

			<p>“Still descending.” confirmed the navigator.</p>

			<p>Jason’s head throbbed again. He winced, then shivered as he felt himself vomiting into his mouth. Half gagging, he leaned forward and swallowed it back down his throat, barely being able to stifle a hopeless groan. His brain seemed to swim in his skull. His eyes were staring into a blur, his mind imprisoned inside a doomed body, trapped inside the damp fabric of his sweat drenched uniform. Again, the hull creaked, only this time with a far louder report, as if the ship itself was crying out in protest of its fate.</p>

			<p>“Sir? Where are you going?” asked Palmer.</p>

			<p>But Jason was already stepping through the hatchway. He leaned against the side of the hull as he slowly made his way down the tight corridor towards where his quarters lay. Two technicians rushed past him in a panicked sprint towards the control room. They barely noticed him standing there, head pressed against the door, as he fumbled with the door handle.</p>

			<p>It was at that moment that the sub lurched sideways without the slightest warning, sending Jason barrelling through the door and into his cabin. He scrambled to his feet only for the sub to heave the other way, landing him on the corner of the doorway. There was a distant sound of shattering glass which seemed to emanate from the control room. Paying no attention, Jason began to crawl along the floor towards his desk drawer. The chaos in the control room was rapidly fading from his perception.</p>

			<p>At last, Jason yanked open his desk drawer and removed the standard issue pistol from inside. He had cleaned and loaded it this morning in preparation for the expected battle. He saw his distorted reflection in the polished barrel and found himself staring into his own half maddened eyes. There was a cut on his lip, and an emerging bruise on his forehead.</p>

			<p>The sub pitched forward, flinging him into the side of the desk. Jason seated himself securely against the side of the desk, pressing his feet into the floor to steady himself. He gripped the pistol more firmly in his hand and studied the weapon, turning it over in his hands.</p>

			<p>The question of where he would place it was a matter which he had devoted considerable thought to in the leadup to this moment. He had ruled out putting it under his chin, fully aware that it could partially miss the brain, thus preventing the swift death which he now desired. A childhood friend had put a gun in his mouth and that had worked quite well, but Jason had already settled on the side of the head. He considered the three options once again. There was no doubt that the side of the head was the best.</p>

			<p>It was at this moment that Jason heard a series of rapid thuds against a metal floor. Someone was running down the outside corridor, their footsteps very close now.</p>

			<p>Jason unceremoniously shoved his pistol back into the desk drawer, slamming it shut with excessive force. He turned to see the sonar operator just coming into view, gripping the side of the doorway to steady himself. There was a slight smile on his face, indicating a strange sense of hope. The smile only grew as the operator opened his mouth to speak, his eyes retaining their lively tint, even now.</p>

			<p>It is unsurprising that Jason did not take kindly to this display of optimism. The human mind has a way of rejecting anything that does not translate well to its current situation, completely alienating all empathy for incompatible beliefs. As captain of a submarine, Jason was well aware of this, but at this moment of hopelessness, he did not find this element of his experience particularly relevant.</p>

			<p>The human mind also has a way of laying blame on another person without any qualms over the effect this could have down the road, and this is especially true when the mind is under pressure. Having never been in such a hopeless situation, one which could only end with the worst manner of death his imagination could conceive, it was safe to say that Jason was indeed under pressure.</p>

			<p>There was the operator, standing there, leaning into the cabin, and glancing down at his captain, unsure whether to deliver his message or wait. Jason glared back at the operator, his left hand searching for a grip on the desk drawer. The operator took a step into his cabin, his eyes glancing nervously at Jason’s hand. Jason ignored this stare as he began to pull open the drawer. He evaluated how quickly the operator would react, reminding himself that the pistol safety was still on and would need to be switched off. He would have to act like he was going to use it on himself and hope that the operator would step in to save him.</p>

			<p>He pulled open the drawer and began feeling for the pistol. He examined the operator’s face, which was quickly filling with uncertainty. He would have to say something to keep the operator from fleeing too early.</p>

			<p>“Leave me.” Jason whispered, carefully measuring out the volume of his words. Just loud enough for the operator to hear, but just quiet enough that he’d need a second or two to process the order.</p>

			<p>Jason found the pistol and gripped it firmly in his hand. He would need to try and tackle the operator and restrain him until he could get an unmissable shot.</p>

			<p>“But sir, we’ve restored auxiliary ballast control.” came the operator, at last processing through Jason’s order.</p>

			<p>Jason hesitated mid-pounce, falling forward on the balls of his feet. He swung inwards, hinging on his armed hand, which had caught itself against the side of the draw, while breaking his fall with his free hand. Without hesitation, he swung himself back around, falling backwards into his previous pose. He looked up at the confusion on the operator’s face.</p>

			<p>“Wait outside.” ordered Jason, bring all the command he could muster into his voice.</p>

			<p>“Yes sir.” replied the operator, recognising the tone. Yet Jason could clearly identify the suspicion now present in the man’s voice. A dangerous suspicion, with an undertone of deep-set mistrust. Jason hesitated, his left hand still gripping the pistol in the drawer. Only a fool would have missed the implications of such a conspicuous attempt to conceal something. The operator was not particularly intelligent, but he was no fool.</p>

			<p>Jason adjusted his grip on the pistol and quickly withdrew it from the drawer, ignoring the faint voice of rationality which urged him to reconsider his intended course of action. With his free hand, Jason reached back into the drawer and withdrew a small silencer which he clumsily screwed on to the pistol with a shaking hand. Pulling himself to his feet, he hurriedly stuffed the pistol into his belt, covering it with his sweat-soaked shirt so that only a small bulge remained visible.</p>

			<p>The captain took a breath, preparing himself for the onslaught of activity which the task ahead would consist of. Exhaling loudly, he made his way out of the cabin.</p></div>
